                        <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
                   
                        <p>I'm a bit of a nomad at heart, having lived in several vibrant cities across the United States, including St. Louis, Chicago, Atlanta, Little Rock, and Pittsburgh. Each place has contributed a unique thread to the fabric of my life, enriching my experiences and worldview.</p>
                        <p>I'm proud to hold a master's degree in Computational Analysis from the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology. My academic journey began with an undergraduate degree in Business Economics from Hendrix College, where I discovered my passion for data and analytics.</p>
                        <p>Family is the cornerstone of my life. I'm blissfully married to my wonderful wife, Sarah, since June 2022. We are eagerly awaiting the arrival of our little girl, Gaia, who is already the light of our lives.</p>
                        <p>My work ethic is something I take great pride in. I'm a hard worker, dedicated to every task I undertake, whether in my professional career or personal endeavors. Outside of work, I cherish my time with family, embodying the role of a family man with every ounce of my being.</p>
                        <p>Sports have always been a significant part of my life. I was a lacrosse goalie at Hendrix College, where I set a record for the most saves in a single game, a proud 22. These days, you'll find me on the pickleball court, where I enjoy the camaraderie and competition of the game.</p>
                        <p>My passion for sports extends into coaching as well. I've had the privilege of coaching football at Banks County High School, where I recently received an award for Offensive Line Coach of the Year. It's an honor to contribute to the development of young athletes, instilling in them the values of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for visiting my page. I hope this glimpse into my life resonates with you, and I look forward to connecting and sharing more of my journey.</p>
